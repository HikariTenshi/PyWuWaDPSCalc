This is an attempt at making the [WuWa DPS Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vTbG2HfkVxyqvNXF2taikStK-vJJf40QrWa06Fgj17c/edit#gid=0) from [@Maygi](https://github.com/Maygi) run locally using databases in an effort to significantly improve its runtime.

This is heavily WIP and so far only the creation of the databases works.

Feel free to do with this whatever you want as long as you provide credit.
