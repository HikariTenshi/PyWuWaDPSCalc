This is an attempt at making the [WuWa DPS Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vTbG2HfkVxyqvNXF2taikStK-vJJf40QrWa06Fgj17c/edit#gid=0) from [@Maygi](https://github.com/Maygi) run locally using databases in an effort to significantly improve its runtime.

This is heavily WIP and so far only the creation of the databases works.

If you want to create the database yourself, make sure to put the credentials.json file in the same folder as import_sheets.py
To get your own credentials.json file, follow the guide here:
https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html#for-end-users-using-oauth-client-id

Feel free to do with this whatever you want as long as you provide credit.
